% Comment.sty   version 3.6, October 1999
%
% Purpose:
% selectively in/exclude pieces of text: the user can define new
% comment versions, and each is controlled separately.
% Special comments can be defined where the user specifies the
% action that is to be taken with each comment line.

% This style can be used with plain TeX or LaTeX, and probably
% most other packages too.
%
% Usage: all text included between
%    \comment ... \endcomment
% or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment}
% is discarded. 
%
% The opening and closing commands should appear on a line
% of their own. No starting spaces, nothing after it.
% This environment should work with arbitrary amounts
% of comment, and the comment can be arbitrary text.
%
% Other `comment' environments are defined by
% and are selected/deselected with
% \includecomment{versiona}
% \excludecoment{versionb}
%
% These environments are used as
% \versiona ... \endversiona
% or \begin{versiona} ... \end{versiona}
% with the opening and closing commands again on a line of 
% their own.
%
% LaTeX users note: for an included comment, the
% \begin and \end lines act as if they don't exist.
% In particular, they don't imply grouping, so assignments 
% &c are not local.
%
% Special comments are defined as
% \specialcomment{name}{before commands}{after commands}
% where the second and third arguments are executed before
% and after each comment block. You can use this for global
% formatting commands.
% To keep definitions &c local, you can include \begingroup
% in the `before commands' and \endgroup in the `after commands'.
% ex:
% \specialcomment{smalltt}
%     {\begingroup\ttfamily\footnotesize}{\endgroup}
% You do *not* have to do an additional
% \includecomment{smalltt}
% To remove 'smalltt' blocks, give \excludecomment{smalltt}
% after the definition.
%
% Processing comments can apply processing to each line.
% \processcomment{name}{each-line commands}%
%    {before commands}{after commands}
% By defining a control sequence 
% \def\Thiscomment##1{...} in the before commands the user can
% specify what is to be done with each comment line.
% BUG this does not work quite yet BUG
%
% Trick for short in/exclude macros (such as \maybe{this snippet}):
%\includecomment{cond}
%\newcommand{\maybe}[1]{}
%\begin{cond}
%\renewcommand{\maybe}[1]{#1}
%\end{cond}
%
% Basic approach of the implementation:
% to comment something out, scoop up  every line in verbatim mode
% as macro argument, then throw it away.
% For inclusions, in LaTeX the block is written out to
% a file \CommentCutFile (default "comment.cut"), which is
% then included.
% In plain TeX (and other formats) both the opening and
% closing comands are defined as noop.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Changes in version 3.1
% - updated author's address
% - cleaned up some code
% - trailing contents on \begin{env} line is always discarded
%  even if you've done \includecomment{env}
% - comments no longer define grouping!! you can even
%   \includecomment{env}
%   \begin{env}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \end{env}
%  Isn't that something ...
% - included comments are written to file and input again.
% Changes in 3.2
% - \specialcomment brought up to date (thanks to Ivo Welch).
% Changes in 3.3
% - updated author's address again
% - parametrised \CommentCutFile
% Changes in 3.4
% - added GNU public license
% - added \processcomment, because Ivo's fix (above) brought an
%   inconsistency to light.
% Changes in 3.5
% - corrected typo in header.
% - changed author email
% - corrected \specialcomment yet again.
% - fixed excludecomment of an earlier defined environment.
% Changes in 3.6
% - The 'cut' file is now written more verbatim, using \meaning;
%   some people reported having trouble with ISO latin 1, or umlaute.sty.
% - removed some \newif statements.
%   Has this suddenly become \outer again?
%
% Known bugs:
% - excludecomment leads to one superfluous space
% - processcomment leads to a superfluous line break
